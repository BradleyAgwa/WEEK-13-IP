# Advertisement & Customer Behavior Analysis with R
###### By Bradley Agwa

## Description
### Advert
Targeted advertising is a form of advertising, including online advertising, that is directed towards an audience with certain traits, based on the product or person the advertiser is promoting. These traits can either be demographic with a focus on race, economic status, sex, age, generation, level of education, income level, and employment, or there can be a psychographic focus which is based on the consumer values, personality, attitude, opinion, lifestyle and interest. This focus can also entail behavioral variables, such as browser history, purchase history, and other recent online activities. Targeted advertising is focused on certain traits and consumers who are likely to have a strong preference.

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

The dataset provided contains information on previous ads that had been posted on a blog. The objective is to analyse these data and develop a profile of persons that are most likely to click on similar ads posted on the blog in future.

### Customer Behavior

Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis. 
The findings should help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand.
